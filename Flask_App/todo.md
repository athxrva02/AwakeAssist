# ToDO
- Close one's email
-- Need to retrieve the close person email somehow


- Play audio natively in the flask app instead of python with pygame
-- The solution may be to shift all the detection files into the dashboard route. (Speed concern?)
-- Static changes need to be made
-- Locally run all the files using the audio flag in flask? Still doubtful
