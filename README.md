# AwakeAssist
A drowsiness detection webapp made with Flask and OpenCV. Used Haarcascades to detect drowsiness in eyes and alert the user with an audible beep. The beep continues till eyes are opened. Used dynamic routing with flask for login and password reset. 
Used Flask mail for OTP in password reset.
